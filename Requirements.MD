# Calendar Requirements

## Basics

Romans start counting with 1 - NOT zero! (*"Die spinnen, die RÃ¶mer!"*)

### Days

A day is a day, easily observable by the rise of the sun. The day is the basic unit. The task of a calendar is to define structures that help to identify days and make them comparable - did day A happen before or after day B?

A calendar is a form of a total ordering over the set of all days.

## Early roman calendars

In the beginning - after the founding of the city - for several centuries there was not one roman calendar. It was a number of various local calendars, some lunar based, some solar based. Origin were outdated etruscan calendars.

## The legendary ten months calendar

The ten month calendar is a calendar that later romans claimed were used by the early romans. There is lack of evidence and it seems like a post-hoc construction rather than a clear historical fact. (For this exercise we assume that the legendary ten month calendar was the indeed the first standardized all roman calendar)

### Years

Till the year 507 b.c. (before christ) romans did not count years. Years were named after reigning consuls.

After the founding of the Jupiter temple the years were counted based on the founding date of Rome. 753 b.c. Rome is founded. This equates to the year 1 a.u.c. (Ab urbe condita) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_urbe_condita]

For this exercise we assume that the a.u.c. naming was used.

### Months

The calendar did start at March (think about it: September is based on septime, October based on octo, November on novo, December on dece). There was an early misunderstanding, that the year did start in March but did also end in December. Rather romans did have another month between December and March which was not named and was fifty days long. This represents the fact that winter time was a time of less meetings and less urgency.

Month names and length:

| **Name** | **Length** |
|----------|-----------|
| Martius | 31 |
| Aprilis | 30 |
| Maius | 31 |
| Iunius | 30 |
| Quintilis | 31 |
| Sextilis | 30 |
| September | 30 |
| October | 31 |
| November | 30 |
| December | 30 |
| - | 50 |

Length of a year was 354 days.

### Nundinal weeks

Based on ancient etruscan calendar in which each day was reserved for an audience with the king.

*Nundinae* was the market day. *Nundinum* or *internundinum* translates to nine-day-week. It describes a week of eight days length. Seven days plus the market day. The market day is the inclusive beginning and inclusive end of a nundinal week marked as A.

Days were named with the nundinal letters A to H.

A B C D E F G H **A B C D E F G H A** B C D E F G H

## Roman Republic calendar

The laws of the twelve tables (449 BC) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Tables]

First official law of the Rome, that consolidated earlier practices. Based on these laws there was a board of ten men named *Decemviri legibus scribundis* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decemviri_legibus_scribundis] that had among many other tasks to fix the calendar. They introduced the Roman Republic calendar.

### Years

Till the year 507 b.c. (before christ) romans did not count years. Years were named after reigning consuls.

After the founding of the Jupiter temple the years were counted based on the founding date of Rome. 753 b.c. Rome is founded. This equates to the year 1 a.u.c. (Ab urbe condita) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_urbe_condita]
